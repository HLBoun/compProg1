Requirements:
- Dynam--alloc Array
- userdefined num of scores
- Negative num checker
- Sort scores
- Drop lowest
- Average scores
- Output sorted scores and Average
- Headings for scores/avgs
- ** use pointer not. when possible
- separate functions


    First, make the function that allows the user to 
define the size & contents of the array. Make sure
negative nums/ letters can not be entered for both.
Add the scores via pointer as they are inputted.

    Sort the array from small->large using any algorithm.
It is likely Prof. Comp will manually input 3-4 nums.
Subtract contents of array[0], then divide by
sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]) (will test for 2 byte
integers)

    Print out headers with proper spacing. Then
scores/avg's, each on new lines.
